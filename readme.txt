2. Activate the SupporterWall Shortcode plugin in the Plugins area of the admin panel.
2. Place `[supporterwall key="YOUR_KEY"]` in your templates where you want the wall to show up.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a SupporterWall to use this plugin =

Technically, no... but it won't do anything without an active wall. Go to http://www.supporterwall.com to sign up and get your wall code.

= Where do I get the `key` value from? =

When you're looking at your wall, the key value will be in the URL. It's a 10 character random string. For example, in this URL:

http://www.supporterwall.com/w/bhjtvp7py9

The key is **bhjtvp7py9**.
